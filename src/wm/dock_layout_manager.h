// itself only draws: it never unmaps, and it learns nothing about the pointer.
// A panel such as the status bar follows the same rules, minus the setting: it
// only gives way to a fullscreen window.
//
// Two decisions, as upstream: the visibility state comes from the setting and
// from the windows on the dock's output; the auto-hide state, only meaningful
// under AutoHide, from what would be interrupted by hiding - the pointer on the
// dock or at its edge, a menu of the dock's, the launcher - and from whether
// there is a window to make room for at all. A dock hides at once and comes
// back after kRevealDelayMs, so brushing the screen edge does not pop it out.
// A dock or panel that maps slides in from its edge, as the session starts.
// The window overview pushes the panels off their edge as it comes in,
// following its progress, and lets them back as it leaves.
