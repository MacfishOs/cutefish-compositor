// and each ordered left to right by their horizontal ones, so the windows keep
// roughly to where they are. A smaller window takes more room in its row than
// its size, by the fourth root of how much smaller its area is than the
// largest one's. The
// rows are scaled together to fit `area`, never enlarging a window, and
// centred; each window then grows on its own into the room left around it,
// keeping its shape and never past its own size. At least `gap` logical pixels
// stay between any two windows. Rectangles land on whole pixels of an output
// at `deviceScale`.
//
// The same windows in the same order always give the same arrangement.
