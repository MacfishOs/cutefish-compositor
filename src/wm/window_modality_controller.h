// Adapted for Cutefish: only window-modal transients exist; system and child
// modality have no Wayland or X11 source. Every Window is already a toplevel,
// so GetToplevelWindow disappears. The WindowManager's input sink calls in
// instead of a pre-target handler, and the bounce animation, touch
// cancellation and capture release are not ported.
