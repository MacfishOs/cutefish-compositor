// Revision: 7acd40ddefff49c9d36144999aafdbb674dbd07a
//
// What is taken: the separation of "which window is active" from "where input
// goes", the activation-change ordering, what happens when the active window
// is destroyed or hidden, and redirecting activation to a modal transient.
// What is dropped: aura's focused-window-inside-active-window distinction
// (Cutefish has no nested focusable widgets) and the FocusRules indirection.
