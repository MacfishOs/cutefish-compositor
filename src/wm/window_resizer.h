// Modelled on chromium/src/ash/wm/window_resizer.* and
// default_window_resizer.* (revision 7acd40ddefff49c9d36144999aafdbb674dbd07a).
//
// The delta/origin/size math is Ash's, including the trick of clamping the
// delta - not just the resulting size - so that the origin computation keeps
// the opposite edge fixed once a size limit is reached, and the restore-bounds
// branch of GetOriginForDrag/GetSizeForDrag that pulls a tiled window out from
// under the pointer. Chromium's HT* constants are replaced by ResizeEdge, and
// aspect ratio, touch resize and multi-display handling are dropped. Ash also
// shifts the origin so the pointer never lands on a caption button of the
// restored frame; that needs the frame's button layout and is left out.
