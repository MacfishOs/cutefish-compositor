//
// Adapted for Cutefish: upstream switches desks with four fingers and keeps
// three for its overview; here three fingers sideways switch desks and three
// fingers up and down bring the overview in and take it away, both following
// the fingers. libinput swipes stand in for ui::ScrollEvent. The desk content
// follows the fingers whatever the scrolling direction is set to, and by the
// distance they travel on the pad rather than by accelerated pointer motion,
// which would run ahead of a quick swipe and lag a slow one. A swipe that
// starts while something is being dragged, a window or data, switches
// nothing: the drag would carry across desks mid-flight.
