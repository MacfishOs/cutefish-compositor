// Adapted for Cutefish: a desk owns no container. Its windows keep their
// places in the window manager's one stacking order, and a desk that is not
// active hides them with Window::setDeskHidden, as upstream hides its
// containers. Metrics, saved desks, coral and per-user state are not carried
// over.
