// RootWindowDeskSwitchAnimator for every output at once. Upstream screenshots
// the whole root; here only what lies below this node in its parent - the
// desktop and the desks' windows - slides, while the panels and the dock stay
// put above it.
//
// The phases are upstream's:
// (1) start() gets the starting desk's frame for each output, taken before the
//     ending desk is activated, and covers the desk content with it.
// (2) Once the ending desk is active underneath, takeEndingScreenshot() has each
//     output copy the content at its next frame; the ending-screenshot callback
//     runs when every output has.
// (3) startAnimation() slides the strip of desk frames towards the ending desk;
//     the finished callback runs once it lands.
//
// Positions are in desk frames: the frame at index k of the strip is fully on
// screen at position k. Upstream keeps a translation per root instead, whose
// touchpad conversion scales with the root's width, which comes to the same.
//
// Unlike upstream, a swipe moves the strip with the fingers, resampled at each
// frame's time as ui::LinearResampling does, pulls against the strip's ends
// like a rubber band, and lets go into a spring that keeps the fingers' speed;
// keyboard switches ride the same spring. Upstream's fixed-length tweens left
// the desk behind the fingers and cut short or stretched every release.
