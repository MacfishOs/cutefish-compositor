//     time), and
//   * the buffer is no longer the committed content of any surface, unless
//     the compositor does not retain client storage at all.
//
// The second condition is what retainsClientStorage() relaxes: shm contents are
// copied into a GL texture, so the client may reuse its storage as soon as that
// copy has been issued, even while the buffer is still on screen.
