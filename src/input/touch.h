// Adapted for Cutefish: the seat resolves each new touch point's target once
// and hands it to every client's Touch, where aura targets the event before
// its pre-target handlers see it. A frame follows each libinput frame rather
// than each event, which is the end-of-sequence signal upstream's TODO asks
// ui::TouchEvent for. The stylus delegate is not carried over.
