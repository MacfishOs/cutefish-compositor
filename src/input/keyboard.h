// Upstream: chromium/src/components/exo/keyboard.h
// Revision: 7acd40ddefff49c9d36144999aafdbb674dbd07a
//
// Adapted for Cutefish: integrates the upstream behavior with native
// compositor types and ownership.
//
// Adaptation: the key-ack extension, IME interaction and the virtual-keyboard
// type reporting are dropped. Accelerators are not processed here: without a
// key-ack there is no post-target pass, so accelerators::AcceleratorFilter
// handles them all before the seat dispatches to any keyboard. What remains
// is focus follow, the pressed-key set delivered on enter, modifier and layout
// resend, and repeat settings.
