// IOHIDAccelerationAlgorithm.cpp) with the curve table of its generic HID
// pointer personality (IOHIDFamily/Info-IOHIDEventDriver.plist): a polynomial
// that is nearly linear at a crawl and bends upwards through the middle
// speeds, continued along its tangent, then growing as a square root, so a
// flick still reaches far without running away. ChromeOS keeps its curves in
// libgestures, which the Chromium tree does not carry.
//
// `speed` is the settings slider, -1 to 1, with a step per table entry: -1 is
// the first (linear, no acceleration), 0 the fourth and default (0.6875), 1
// the last (3), each step below 0 a third and each above it a sixth. Between
// steps the curve is interpolated as the table is.
